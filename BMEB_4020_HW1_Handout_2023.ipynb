    "1. Implement the Wilson neuron model defined by the equations above. You are asked to implement [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) for solving differential equations numerically. Essentially, for the differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) + I(t)$, we iteratively evaluate the value of $x(t+\\Delta t)$ given the previous value $x(t)$ and the gradient of $f(x(t)) + I(t)$ as $\\frac{x(t+\\Delta t) - x(t)}{\\Delta t} = f(x(t)) + I(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assuming that $a_k=constant, -M \\le m \\le M$, with initial conditions $V(0)=-0.7mV, R(0)=0.088 (unitless)$, plot the input and the output of the Wilson neuron on the time interval [0, 200] ms, using an $a_k$ such that the neuron robustly spikes. \n",
    "    * Make sure to show one plot featuring both input current and membrane voltage. You can use the `.twinx()` function in `matplotlib` (google documentation if you wish) to create two y-axes in one plot.\n",
    "    * We recommend experimenting with a wide range of $a_k$ values to see its effect on the voltage spikes.\n",
    "    * Since Wilson model's voltage scale is *100 smaller* than the biophysically accurate range (e.g., $V(0)=-70mV$ would be the biophysical norm), feel free to scale up in your plot the voltage output by 100 times.  \n",
    "3. Empirically determine a range of values for the $a_k$'s that makes the neuron fire. Plot the total number of spikes fired in the interval [0, 200] ms for a broad range of $a_k = constant$ values. For the same range of input current values, show the following\n",

    "    2. spike rate (spikes per second)\n",
    "    3. spike amplitude (Voltage value at spike time)\n",
    "4. Assume the input current is $I(t) = c\\cdot u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is a [Heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function), and $c$ is amplitude of the injected current in $pA$. Find a range of values for $c$ such that the Wilson neuron exhibits periodic spiking (limit cycle). Draw the limit cycle in the $V$ vs. $R$ plane for at least 3 different values of $c$, comment on the effect of the amplitude $c$ on the limit cycle and the membrane voltage based on your results."
